# cs202-labs

This repository is for all of my labs that I did for my data structures lab. 
All of the information for the labs can be found on https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs202/Labs/Lab#/

Gradescripts can be run with `/home/plank/cs202/Labs/Lab#/gradeall` **Only works with Hydra machines** 

Due to academic honesty, I did not upload my labs during the semester, and rather uploaded all the labs once I was done with the class.
